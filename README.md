# Morphological-image-processing
Using morphological image processing to process an image with coffee grains and recognize the grains on the processed image.

Assignment which describes how we can use different morphological image processing methods in order to fix the appearance of an image, which is needed so we can perform recognition and similar algorithms on the image.

Please refer to Project report.pdf for much more detailed explanation of the implementation of the assignment.
